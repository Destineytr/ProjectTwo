    Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when
    <br/>
    Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
    <br/>
    Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
    <br/>
    You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again
    <br/>
    I'll send you my love on a wire
    <br/>
    Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
    <br/>
    From you
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Got balls of steel, got an automobile, for a minimum wage
    <br/>
    Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space
    <br/>
    Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
    <br/>
    You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again
    <br/>
    I'll send you my love on a wire
    <br/>
    Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
    <br/>
    It's a mechanical bull, the number one
    <br/>
    You'll take a ride from anyone
    <br/>
    Everyone wants a ride, pulls away, ooh, from you
    <br/>
</p>
